=== Windows
in order to compile rsx++ first you need to compile wxWidgets (get source from wxWidgets svn)
to do this, put whole package in this directory and compile wxWidgets library using scripts (compile32.bat and compile64.bat)
remember to load enviroment before compilation (vcvars32.bat or vcvars64.bat)

=== Linux
not tested, but probably preinstalled packages should do the trick
